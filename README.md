# Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of small Python projects and practice scripts!  
I'm currently learning Python and using this space to experiment, build logic, and improve my skills one project at a time.

# What's Inside

This repo includes:
- Beginner-level projects like number guessing, contact book, and word counters.
- Practice with key Python concepts: conditionals, loops, dictionaries, functions, file handling, and more.
- Personal challenges and mini-tools to build confidence before moving into larger, real-world apps.

# Why This Repo?

- To track my daily/weekly Python practice.
- To document my progress and learning journey.
- To have a place to improve and later refactor as I grow.

# Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

# Note

These projects are beginner-level by design. I'm sharing them publicly to stay accountable, track growth, and invite feedback from others who are learning or mentoring.
